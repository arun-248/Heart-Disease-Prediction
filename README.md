### Heart Disease Predictor

This project is a powerful machine learning solution for predicting the presence of heart disease. It leverages a dataset of patient information to build a predictive model that can classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease.

#### Project Overview
At the heart of this project is a **Logistic Regression** model, chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The process involves:

* **Data Analysis**: The model begins with a thorough analysis of the provided dataset, ensuring data quality by checking for any missing values.
* **Model Training**: The dataset is prepared and used to train the logistic regression model.
* **Performance Evaluation**: The model's predictive capabilities are rigorously tested and evaluated. The project achieves an optimal accuracy score, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of building a predictive model from scratch, highlighting the critical steps of data analysis, training, and evaluation for a real-world application.
